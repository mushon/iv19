        "content": "Datorama brings together multiple marketing data sources into one consolidated data model, that allows marketing analysts to query and analyze all their marketing data in one unified place.\nThat’s a technological wonder, the cutting edge in the field of marketing analytics. But to be trusted and utilized, the magic needs to be understood. The analysts know a lot about their data sources, but less about Datorama’s unified data model. Furthermore, they want a solid understanding of how their data is “mapped” into that data model.\nIn this talk we’ll walk through the iterative process of creating a new data model visualization, meant to improve this understanding.\nBuilding upon the existing - robust and informative, yet “dry” - module, we offered a dynamic visualization tool, giving a high-level overview of the entire data model’s structure, and allowing the analysts to explore through the model, discover relations between entities, view calculations over those entities and more.",
